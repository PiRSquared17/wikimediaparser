A parser for entire articles, as well as individual parts of, wikimedia articles.

The darcs repository can be found [here](http://patch-tag.com/r/tehgeekmeister/WikimediaParser) and the current release [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/WikimediaParser-0.1), the google code project is intended solely for wiki and bug tracking, so I won't be uploading any code here.
